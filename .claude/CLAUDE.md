## Visual Development

### Design Principles
- Comprehensive design checklist in `/context/design-principles.md`
- Brand style guide in `/context/style-guide.md`
- When making visual (front-end, UI/UX) changes, always refer to these files for guidance



This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review
Invoke the `@design-reviewer.md` subagent for thorough design validation when:
- Completing significant UI/UX features
- Before finalizing PRs with visual changes
- Needing comprehensive accessibility and responsiveness testing
